# All-in-Gym Website

This is a website for a commercial gym located in Dublin, Ireland. The website attracts new members for the business' owners by providing key relevant information to potential members in a sleek and easy-to-follow format. The website is easily navigatable for new users and interested potential new members are subtly encouraged to sign-up to a free trial which is one of the business' owners key marketing tools. 

The website is a key tool in maintaining the connection between the gym and its existing members. This is achieved by providing up-to-date information to existing members on the latest gym news, upcoming gym events and class schedules and through the regular posting of motivational content.

## Development Cycle and Commit Messages

The Gitpod IDE was used to develop this project and changes to the files were "committed" and "pushed" to the project repository in GitHub as the development cycle progressed. When viewing the commit messages in the project repository, please take note that the following notation was used when committing;

X.Y "Description of Changes Made to the File(s)"

where X = a number associated with a particualar webpage (see below), Y = the Yth commit associated with this webpage

X-values are as follows; for Home X=1, for Sign Up X=2, for Our Classes X=3, for What Our Members Say X=4, for Our Facilities X=5, for Gallery X=6, for News X=7

For example, a commit message of "3.4 Changes to allow table re-sizing across various screen sizes" relates to changes made to the Our Classes page and this is the 4th commit relating to this page.

Similarly, a commit titled "1.9 + 4.3 + 6.3 alt attributes added to images" relates to changes made to the Home, What Our Members Say and Gallery pages and these are the 9th, 3rd and 3rd respective commits relating to these pages.

Where X and Y numbers do not precede the git commit message these are changes to the project files not specific to any one webpage, for example, the commit message "Updated Features section in README.md".
